A feature-rich To-Do List application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, focusing on modern frontend practices and a clean user experience. This project was developed as part of [Mention your course/program, e.g., the 1st Year Computer Engineering Cycle at ENSA Berrechid].

## Features ✨

*   **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update (Toggle Complete, Edit Text/Priority/Date), and Delete tasks.
*   **Persistence:** Tasks are saved to the browser's Local Storage, so they aren't lost on refresh.
*   **Filtering:** Filter tasks by status (All / Active / Completed).
*   **Sorting:** Sort tasks by Creation Date, Due Date, or Priority (Ascending/Descending).
*   **Priorities:** Assign Low, Medium, or High priority to tasks with visual indicators.
*   **Due Dates:** Set optional due dates for tasks, with visual indication for overdue items.
*   **Task Count:** Displays the number of active tasks remaining.
*   **Clear Completed:** Button to easily remove all finished tasks.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
*   **TypeScript:** Strongly typed codebase for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
*   **CSS Modules:** Scoped CSS for component styling without class name conflicts.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

*   **Framework/Library:** React 18+
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules
*   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useReducer`, `useState`, `useMemo`)
*   **Unique IDs:** `uuid`
*   **Date Handling:** `date-fns`
